## Hmm sounds OK {#hmm-sounds-ok}

Heracleitus called the Universal Principle
(των απαντων αρχη) Intellectual Fire (πυρ
νοερον), and said that the sphere surrounding
us and reaching to the Moon was filled with
evil, but beyond the Moon-sphere it was
purer.[97]

Perhaps this is to say that most of Creation isn't corrupted.
But around Earth, it kinda is.
Perhaps the corruption hasn't spread far from Earth.

## Scriptures {#scriptures}

[1 Corinthians 15:33](https://biblehub.com/kjv/1%5Fcorinthians/15.htm)
: 33 Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners. 34 Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.
