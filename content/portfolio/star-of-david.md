_**Work in Progress**_

This morning as I was waking up, the Star of
David appeared in my mind.

I want to learn more about it.

Reading material:

-   <https://www.chabad.org/library/article%5Fcdo/aid/788679/jewish/Star-of-David-The-Mystical-Significance.htm>

My eyes were closed so it was glimmering
faintly against the blackness.
