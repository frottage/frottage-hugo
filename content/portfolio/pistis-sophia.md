## Her name {#her-name}

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
In Theosophical terms, Pistis Sophia
represents the soul, or more specifically, the
part of the soul that incarnates; namely, the
monad of consciousness in the concrete mind.
Her name is a key to her role: Pistis is the
Greek word for "faith." Not blind faith, but
faith arising from total conviction of inner
knowledge.

Sophia is Greek for "wisdom."
{{< /highlight >}}

Pistis Sophia is a double name.

[Gospel of Philip](https://mullikine.github.io/posts/gospel-of-philip/)
: "The Father" and "the Son" are single names; "the Holy Spirit" is a double name.


## Wiki summary {#wiki-summary}

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
In Gnosticism, Sophia is a feminine figure,
analogous to the human soul but also
simultaneously one of the feminine aspects of
God.

Gnostics held that she was the syzygy (female
twin divine Aeon) of Jesus (i.e. the Bride
of Christ), and Holy Spirit of the Trinity.

She is occasionally referred to by the Hebrew
equivalent of Achamōth (Ἀχαμώθ, Hebrew: חכמה
chokhmah) and as Prunikos (Προύνικος).

In the Nag Hammadi texts, Sophia is the lowest
Aeon, or anthropic expression of the emanation
of the light of God.

She is considered to have fallen from grace in
some way, in so doing creating or helping to
create the material world.

## Her mission {#her-mission}

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
After several incidents with the entities of
the lower planes, Jesus finds Pistis Sophia
(whose name means "Faith Wisdom") below the
Thirteenth Aeon, her original home.
{{< /highlight >}}

Thus her compound name indicates the
fundamental principle (faith in the Lightâ€”an
aspect of God) that enables her to undertake
her mission, namely, the development of wisdom
in both worlds.

Once she descended from her place of origin,
she was dragged further and further down into
chaos, with the emanations of the Self-
Centered One and the Twelve Aeons constantly
chasing after her, trying to take her light
away.

## The Pearl - Melee {#the-pearl-melee}

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
In the Pistis Sophia, Sophia is the first
feminine principle, a goddess.

Pistis Sophia (Faith-Wisdom, Sophia the
daughter) falls from grace to Earth when she
follows a light she thinks will bring her to
the highest place but she is set upon by
material powers who deprive her of her own
light.

She falls into the physical world of darkness.

She is redeemed by the Saviour (her consort,
Christ) perhaps when he cast seven spirits out
of her and helps to redeem her as a goddess.

Mary Magdalene is identified in the scripture
as Sophia the daughter, the bride of the
bridegroom, the consort of the Saviour.

Christ comes to redeem his pearl and says she
will be “happy beyond every woman who is upon
the earth, because thou art she who will
become the Pleroma of the Pleroma.”The Pleroma
is the fullness of being, the light of truth
or the highest plane, Heaven.
{{< /highlight >}}

[The Hymn of the Pearl](https://mullikine.github.io/posts/hymn-of-the-pearl/)
: And [thereon] I snatched up the Pearl, And turned to the House of my Father. And taking with me my Pearl Should with him be seen by our King.

---

[Gospel of Thomas](https://mullikine.github.io/posts/gospel-of-thomas/)
: (76) Jesus said: The kingdom of the Father is like a merchant who had a load (of goods) and found a pearl. That merchant was wise. He sold the load and bought for himself the pearl alone. You also, seek after his treasure which does not fail (but) endures, where moth does not come near to devour nor worm to destroy.

I would trade everything.

I wonder if [the Most Surreal Day](https://mullikine.github.io/posts/the-most-surreal-day/) indicates I have found her.

prethought
    [neologism]

    Having a thought before actually thinking.

    Similar to Freud's preconscious thought.

repairwork
    [neologism]

    Freud:
    - Dreamwork

    Jung:
    - Shadow work

    Me:
    - https://mullikine.github.io/posts/the-tapestry-of-truth/

    Say, Sigmund Freud's Id was a little bit
    damaged - and he embraced it rather than
    allowed God to change it, thus propagating
    the error into the Ego and Super-ego,
    which reinforced the Id. He used the ego
    to bring the Id into conscious reality.

    Jung dissolved the Ego by integrating the
    shadow.

    Repairwork begins with repairing the Id.
