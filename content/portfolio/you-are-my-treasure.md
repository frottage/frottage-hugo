You are my sunshine, my only sunshine.
You make me happy when skies are gray.
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you.
Please don't take my sunshine away.

You are my treasure, my only treasure
How long I've searched for you, you'll never know,
But now I'm rested, that I have found you,
Please don't take my treasure away.
