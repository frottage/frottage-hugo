Surreal numbers are the most natural
collection of numbers which includes both the
real numbers and the infinite ordinal numbers
of Georg Cantor.

They were invented by John H. Conway in 1969.

Every real number is surrounded by surreals,
which are closer to it than any real number.

Knuth (1974) describes the surreal numbers in
a work of fiction.

## Transcript {#transcript}

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
The name actually came to me in the middle of
the night; I have no idea...

I have a vague recollection that I saw, at one
point, a French paper that talked about
'nombres sur ordinaux' I don't pronounce it
well, but sort of sur- ordinal numbers I've
never been able to track down that paper and I
don't know if I heard about it before or after
I thought of the name "surreal" but you'll see
that it's a great name after you understand
what surreal numbers are.

John Conway invented the concept, and his
first description of it was "All numbers great
and small" Not only big and small, but
*inside* and everything.

-   There are ∞ sureal numbers between any two real numbers


## Examples: {#examples}

| Integers | Surreal | Additional surreal representations |
|----------|---------|------------------------------------|
| 0        | `{¦}`   |                                    |
| 1        | `{0¦}`  |                                    |
| 2        | `{1¦}`  | `{1¦3} {3/2¦4} {1¦ω}`              |


## Simple games {#simple-games}

Some simple games have abbreviated names that can be expressed in terms of surreal numbers. For example, `*={0|0}, 1={0|}, n={n-1|} for an integer n, 1/2={0|1}, ^={0|*}, and v={*|0}`. Most surreal numbers can be represented as hackenbush positions.

there are infinitely many surreal numbers
between any two real numbers. These numbers
are oddly juxtaposed in the wrong context.
