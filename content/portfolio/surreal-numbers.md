Surreal numbers are all `syzygies`; Definitely not a mere coincidence.

Surreal numbers are the most natural
collection of numbers which includes both the
real numbers and the infinite ordinal numbers
of Georg Cantor.

They were invented by John H. Conway in 1969.

Every real number is surrounded by surreals,
which are closer to it than any real number.

Knuth (1974) describes the surreal numbers in
a work of fiction.

## Transcript {#transcript}

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
The name actually came to me in the middle of
the night; I have no idea...

I have a vague recollection that I saw, at one
point, a French paper that talked about
'nombres sur ordinaux' I don't pronounce it
well, but sort of sur- ordinal numbers I've
never been able to track down that paper and I
don't know if I heard about it before or after
I thought of the name "surreal" but you'll see
that it's a great name after you understand
what surreal numbers are.

John Conway invented the concept, and his
first description of it was "All numbers great
and small" Not only big and small, but
*inside* and everything.

-   There are ∞ sureal numbers between any two real numbers


## Examples: {#examples}

| Integers | Surreal | Additional surreal representations |
|----------|---------|------------------------------------|
| 0        | `{¦}`   |                                    |
| 1        | `{0¦}`  |                                    |
| 2        | `{1¦}`  | `{1¦3} {3/2¦4} {1¦ω}`              |


## Simple games {#simple-games}

Some simple games have abbreviated names that can be expressed in terms of surreal numbers. For example, `*={0|0}, 1={0|}, n={n-1|} for an integer n, 1/2={0|1}, ^={0|*}, and v={*|0}`. Most surreal numbers can be represented as hackenbush positions.

### The Genesis of Surreal numbers {#the-genesis-of-surreal-numbers}

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
In the beginning, everything was void, and
J.H.W.H. Conway began to create numbers.

Conway said, "Let there be two rules which
bring forth all numbers large and small.

This shall be the first rule:
- Every number corresponds to two sets of
  previously created numbers, such that no
  member of the left set is greater than or
  equal to any member of the right set.

And the second rule shall be this:
- One number is less than or equal to
  another number if and only if no member of
  the first number's left set is greater than
  or equal to the second number, and no member
  of the second number's right set is less
  than or equal to the first number." And
  Conway examined these two rules he had made,
  and behold! They were very good.

And the first number was created from the void
left set and the void right set.

Conway called this number "zero," and said
that it shall be a sign to separate positive
numbers from negative numbers.

Conway proved that zero was less than or equal
to zero, and he saw that it was good.

And the evening and the morning were the day
of zero.

On the next day, two more numbers were
created, one with zero as its left set and one
with zero as its right set.

And Conway called the former number "one," and
the latter he called "minus one." And he
proved that minus one is less than but not
equal to zero and zero is less than but not
equal to one.

And the evening ...

A. I mean - here we are on the edge of the
Indian Ocean, miles away from civilization.
It's been months since we ran off to avoid
getting swept up in the system, and "to [find ourselves](https://mullikine.github.io/posts/the-tapestry-of-truth/)." I'm just wondering if you think
we've done it.

[Gospel of Thomas](https://mullikine.github.io/posts/gospel-of-thomas/)
: "When you know yourselves then you will become known, and you will understand that you are the sons of the living father.

B. Actually, Alice, I've been thinking about the same thing. These
past months together have been really great-we're completely
free, we know each other, and we feel like real people again [instead of like machines](https://mullikine.github.io/posts/the-tapestry-of-truth/).
