## My [Nana](https://mullikine.github.io/posts/the-tapestry-of-truth/) chose this song for my Christening {#my-nana-chose-this-song-for-my-christening}

John Grenell died yesterday.

It's country music but I was 0 years old so, not my fault.

Welcome to my world
Won't you come on in
Miracles, I guess
Still happen now and then

Step into my heart
Leave your cares behind
Welcome to my world
Built with you in mind

Knock and the door will open
Seek and you will find
Ask and you'll be given
The key to this world of mine

I'll be waiting here
With my arms unfurled
Waiting just for you
Welcome to my world

Waiting just for you
Welcome to my world
