The word means literally a public worker,
demioergós, demiourgós, and was originally
used to designate any craftsman plying his
craft or trade for the use of the public.

Soon, however, technítes and other words began
to be used to designate the common artisan
while demiurge was set aside for the Great
Artificer or Fabricator, the Architect of the
universe.

At first the words toû kósmou were added to
distinguish the great Workman from others, but
gradually demiourgós became the technical term
for the Maker of heaven and earth.

In this sense it is used frequently by Plato
in his "Timæus".

Although often loosely employed by the Fathers
and others to indicate the Creator, the word
never strictly meant "one who produces out of
nothing" (for this the Greeks used ktístes),
but only "one who fashions, shapes, and
models".
