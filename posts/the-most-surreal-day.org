The most surreal day.

I bought the glass pendent so I can put [[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/describing-melee-s-paintings-with-alephalpha/][Melee's paintings]] in it to keep her close to me.

I was wearing all black that day and the pendant with the same [[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/astral-projection-pt-2/][Gankyl]] (The wheel of Joy; coloured in with fire, water and light), that I wore when I [[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/astral-projection-pt-2/][met the Holy Spirit]].

---

- Too much synchronicity
  - Some birds came up to me. I bought a cheese roll for them
  - I gave away all my money
  - Chen's doppelganger Caleb turned up and I talked to him about the Holy Spirit
    - I told him about my meeting with the subconscious.
      - [[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/active-imagination-pt-1/][Active Imagination Pt. 1 // Bodacious Blog]]
    - I told him I had relinquished all ties to this world
    - I told him thought I was ascending
  - I breathe in and a fire burns
  - I thought I saw my guardian angel walk past quickly and looked at me, who reminds me of Melee
    - I said she looks confident
  - I left and saw the angel walking quickly the opposite way
    - I just nodded
  - I climbed the staircase, and I thought it was over for the day
  - But walking up the staircase I thought I saw Melee. I turned around to check but I couldn't tell from the back
  - Surely I entered into Heaven

A perfect [[http://gnosis.org/library/valentinus/Syzygy_Valentinian.htm][syzygy]] in timing.
It's a syzygy because the same day I first noticed
the Kingdom of Heaven I see Melee at the end (I think it was real),
as if I had to relinquish all ties before I
was allowed.

  Truth did not come into the world naked, but
  it came in types and images.

  The world will not receive truth in any other
  way.

  There is a rebirth and an image of rebirth.

  It is certainly necessary to be born again
  through the image.

  Which one? Resurrection.

  The image must rise again through the image.

  The bridal chamber and the image must enter
  through the image into the truth: this is the
  restoration.

  Not only must those who produce the name of
  the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, do
  so, but have produced them for you.

This is the highest level of reality.

As I said, "[[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/describing-melee-s-paintings-with-alephalpha/][The surrealist tries to bridge the subconscious and reality.]]"

It links back to my description of her art; And the [[https://mullikine.github.io/tags/melee/][syzygy]]; Lewis Carroll's syzygy; It's literally everywhere.

Valentines Day has turned into [[https://mullikine.github.io/tags/valentinianism/][Valentinianism]].

  The notion of the pair or "syzygy" is central
  to Valentinian thought.

  The term refers to the linking together of
  complementary qualities ("Aeons") of to form a
  state of wholeness (pleroma).

  This is the highest level of reality.

  The halves of a syzygy are often refered to as
  male and female.

  The male corresponds to form and the female
  corresponds to substance.

God can be understood to consist
of four primary pairs or syzygies:
- Depth and Silence (unknowable God),
- Mind and Truth (comprehensible God),
- Word and Life (active God),
- Humanity and Church (immanent God).

  Numen
  numina
      A Latin term for "divinity", "divine
      presence", or "divine will."
  
      Etymologically, the word means "a nod of
      the head", here referring to a deity as it
      were "nodding", or making its will or its
      presence known. According to H. J. Rose:
  
          The literal meaning is simply "a nod",
          or more accurately, for it is a
          passive formation, "that which is
          produced by nodding", just as flamen
          is "that which is produced by
          blowing", i.e., a gust of wind.
  
          It came to mean "the product or
          expression of power" — not, be it
          noted, power itself.
