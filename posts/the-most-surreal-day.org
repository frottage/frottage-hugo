I bought the glass pendent so I can put [[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/describing-melee-s-paintings-with-alephalpha/][Melee's paintings]] in it to keep her close to me.

I was wearing all black that day and the pendant with the same [[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/astral-projection-pt-2/][Gankyl]] (The wheel of Joy; coloured in with fire, water and light), that I wore when I [[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/astral-projection-pt-2/][met the Holy Spirit]].

- Too much synchronicity
  - Some birds came up to me. I bought a cheese roll for them
  - I gave away all my money
  - Chen's doppelganger Caleb turned up and I talked to him about the Holy Spirit
    - I told him about my meeting with the subconscious.
      - [[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/active-imagination-pt-1/][Active Imagination Pt. 1 // Bodacious Blog]]
    - I told him I had relinquished all ties to this world
    - I told him thought I was ascending
  - I breathe in and a fire burns
  - I thought I saw my guardian angel walk past quickly and looked at me, who reminds me of Melee
    - I said she looks confident
  - I left and saw the angel walking quickly the opposite way
    - I just nodded
  - I climbed the staircase, and I thought it was over for the day
  - But walking up the staircase I thought I saw Melee. I turned around to check but I couldn't tell from the back
  - Surely I entered into Heaven

A perfect [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeon_(Gnosticism)][syzygy]] in timing.

  Truth did not come into the world naked, but
  it came in types and images.

  The world will not receive truth in any other
  way.

  There is a rebirth and an image of rebirth.

  It is certainly necessary to be born again
  through the image.

  Which one? Resurrection.

  The image must rise again through the image.

  The bridal chamber and the image must enter
  through the image into the truth: this is the
  restoration.

  Not only must those who produce the name of
  the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, do
  so, but have produced them for you.
