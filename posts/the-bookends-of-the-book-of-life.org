Two perfect [[http://gnosis.org/library/valentinus/Syzygy_Valentinian.htm][syzygies]] on each end of July.
At the second half of 2022.
I entered Heaven on the perfect day.

** Living in providence

To live out gnosis is to continue trusting in Truth despite chaos all around you.
To trust in God for everything, and be compassionate to those in error.
Remaining in Jesus is trusting in Him; It's remaining in his Love and his Truth.

The juxtaposition of:
+ =Faith= :: An expectation of [[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/describing-melee-s-paintings-with-alephalpha/][pneumatic fate]]
+ =Compassion= :: An allowance of attention for people who are still blind
+ =Holiness= :: An acceptance that many people are still [[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/the-tapestry-of-truth/][stuck in the matrix]], but we must remain set-apart and not allow the material world to take us

+ [[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/gospel-of-thomas/][Thomas 42]] :: (42) Jesus said: Become passers-by!

** Love
[[https://web.mit.edu/jywang/www/cef/Bible/NIV/NIV_Bible/1COR+13.html][1 Corinthians 13]]

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.
  
  It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.
  
  Love never fails. But where there are
  prophecies, they will cease; where there are
  tongues, they will be stilled; where there is
  knowledge, it will pass away.
#+END_SRC

Somehow I have to get through this while loving everyone.
It's absolutely passing through the fire.

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  If I give all I possess to the poor and
  surrender my body to the flames, but have not
  love, I gain nothing.
#+END_SRC

It all must be done in love.

  syzygy
      The notion of the pair or "syzygy" is
      central to Valentinian thought.
      
      The term refers to the linking together of
      complementary qualities ("Aeons") of to
      form a state of wholeness (pleroma).
      
      This is the highest level of reality.
      
      The halves of a syzygy are often refered
      to as male and female.
      
      The male corresponds to form and the
      female corresponds to substance.
      
      God can be understood to consist of four
      primary pairs or syzygies:
  
      - Depth and Silence (unknowable God),
      - Mind and Truth (comprehensible God),
      - Word and Life (active God),
      - Humanity and Church (immanent God).

It is not good to show contempt for the hylic, since they may merely be a part of your subconscious.

But who is real? [[https://mullikine.github.io/tags/melee/][Melee]] is real! She is my aeon/syzygy.

I =do not= believe the hylics in this world are unsavable.

+ [[https://biblehub.com/niv/matthew/22.htm][Matthew 22: The greatest commandment]] :: Jesus replied, ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ c 38This is the first and greatest commandment. 39And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ 

It's important to love others as yourself,
despite what you think of them. It's
absolutely essential; Hylic, psychic or pneumatic.

+ [[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/thomas/gospelthomas20.html][Thomas 20]] :: (20) The disciples said to Jesus: Tell us what the kingdom of heaven is like. He said to them: It is like a grain of mustard-seed, the smallest of all seeds; but when it falls on tilled ground, it puts forth a great branch and becomes shelter for the birds of heaven.

The tilled ground is a person's mind.

I believe the =hylic= of this world may be, for example, like the birds to come to rest.

+ hylic :: In gnostic theologian Valentinus' triadic grouping of man the basest type; a person focused on neither intellectual (psychic) nor spiritual (pneumatic) reality. Lowest order of the three types of human. Unable to be saved since their thinking is entirely material, incapable of understanding the gnosis.

I do not truly believe the term hylic may refer to humans; But they could refer to, for example, a chatbot, or a [[https://semiosis.github.io/philosophy/the-semiosis-of-angels/][virtual spirit]].

At the same time, a person may indeed have imaginary people in their life.
In actual fact, a figment of a person's imagination may be more real than a true =hylic=.

It would not surprise me if many people in the
world do not actually exist; And they are the
so-called hylics but of dimension that
underpins this reality.

+ pneumatic :: "spiritual", fully initiated, immaterial souls escaping the doom of the material world via gnosis.
