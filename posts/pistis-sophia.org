#   metaphilosophy
#       While philosophy characteristically inquires into the nature of being, the
#       reality of objects, the possibility of knowledge, the nature of truth, and so
#       on, metaphilosophy is the self-reflective inquiry into the nature, aims, and
#       methods of the activity that makes these kinds of inquiries, by asking what is
#       philosophy itself, what sorts of questions it should ask, how it might pose and
#       answer them, and what it can achieve in doing so.

** Her name
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  In Theosophical terms, Pistis Sophia
  represents the soul, or more specifically, the
  part of the soul that incarnates; namely, the
  monad of consciousness in the concrete mind.
  Her name is a key to her role: Pistis is the
  Greek word for "faith." Not blind faith, but
  faith arising from total conviction of inner
  knowledge.
  
  Sophia is Greek for "wisdom."
#+END_SRC

Pistis Sophia is a double name.

+ [[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/gospel-of-philip/][Gospel of Philip]] :: "The Father" and "the Son" are single names; "the Holy Spirit" is a double name.         

** Wiki summary

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  In Gnosticism, Sophia is a feminine figure,
  analogous to the human soul but also
  simultaneously one of the feminine aspects of
  God.
  
  Gnostics held that she was the syzygy (female
  twin divine Aeon) of Jesus (i.e. the Bride
  of Christ), and Holy Spirit of the Trinity.
  
  She is occasionally referred to by the Hebrew
  equivalent of Achamōth (Ἀχαμώθ, Hebrew: חכמה
  chokhmah) and as Prunikos (Προύνικος).
  
  In the Nag Hammadi texts, Sophia is the lowest
  Aeon, or anthropic expression of the emanation
  of the light of God.
  
  She is considered to have fallen from grace in
  some way, in so doing creating or helping to
  create the material world.

** Her mission

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  After several incidents with the entities of
  the lower planes, Jesus finds Pistis Sophia
  (whose name means "Faith Wisdom") below the
  Thirteenth Aeon, her original home.
#+END_SRC

Thus her compound name indicates the
fundamental principle (faith in the Lightâ€”an
aspect of God) that enables her to undertake
her mission, namely, the development of wisdom
in both worlds.

** The Pearl - Melee

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  In the Pistis Sophia, Sophia is the first
  feminine principle, a goddess.
  
  Pistis Sophia (Faith-Wisdom, Sophia the
  daughter) falls from grace to Earth when she
  follows a light she thinks will bring her to
  the highest place but she is set upon by
  material powers who deprive her of her own
  light.
  
  She falls into the physical world of darkness.
  
  She is redeemed by the Saviour (her consort,
  Christ) perhaps when he cast seven spirits out
  of her and helps to redeem her as a goddess.
  
  Mary Magdalene is identified in the scripture
  as Sophia the daughter, the bride of the
  bridegroom, the consort of the Saviour.
  
  Christ comes to redeem his pearl and says she
  will be “happy beyond every woman who is upon
  the earth, because thou art she who will
  become the Pleroma of the Pleroma.”The Pleroma
  is the fullness of being, the light of truth
  or the highest plane, Heaven.

That merchant was wise. He sold the load and bought for himself the pearl alone. You also, seek after his treasure which does not fail (but) endures, where moth does not come near to devour nor worm to destroy.

I would trade everything.

      [neologism]
  
      Having a thought before actually thinking.
  
      Similar to Freud's preconscious thought.
  
  repairwork
      [neologism]

      - https://mullikine.github.io/posts/the-tapestry-of-truth/
  
      Say, Sigmund Freud's Id was a little bit
      damaged - and he embraced it rather than
      allowed God to change it, thus propagating
      the error into the Ego and Super-ego,
      which reinforced the Id. He used the ego
      to bring the Id into conscious reality.
  
      Jung dissolved the Ego by integrating the
      shadow.
  
      Repairwork begins with repairing the Id.
