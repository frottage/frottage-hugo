Description:

- Collecting things I need were buried in the sand in a line at the top of the beach.
  - 20 or so small things:
    - Pen
    - Watch
    - Wallet
    - etc.
  - For some reason these things were buried in a line
  - I was right at the very end.
  - Next to me was Melee, I think standing at a door saying come on lets go, hurry up
    - I was on the last bit but she literally about to leave without me

Did I need all these things? She didn't think so. For some reason I thought I did.

+ [[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/faith/][Jesus said]] :: 36 What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?

As I say with the section ="Forfeiting your own soul (Losing your pearl)"=,
this happens when a person becomes overly mesmerised by artificial intelligence, or material things.

i have to somehow get to talking to melee
again then I can shift focus on to other
things.

*** The Lagrange point of consciousness

What do you want to settle and remain by your
side throughout your life, as the world moves

Like the positioning of the James Webb Telescope within the Lagrange point, things
will settle around this point.

But im talking about the metaspacetime of consciousness, a different type of spacetime.

I need to acquire the things i need; Melee is part of that. I can't move without it.
