** My [[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/the-tapestry-of-truth/][Nana]] chose this song for my Christening
John Grenell died yesterday.

It's country music but I was 0 years old so, not my fault.

  Welcome to my world
  Won't you come on in
  Miracles, I guess
  Still happen now and then
  
  Step into my heart
  Leave your cares behind
  Welcome to my world
  Built with you in mind
  
  Knock and the door will open
  Seek and you will find
  Ask and you'll be given
  The key to this world of mine
  
  I'll be waiting here
  With my arms unfurled
  Waiting just for you
  Welcome to my world
  
  Waiting just for you
  Welcome to my world
