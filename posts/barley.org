The barley harvest was the first harvest (see Exod. 9:31-32; 2 Sam. 21:9; etc)
and represented the first resurrection.

This first harvest was divided into two parts:
- a premature firstfruits of unripe grain on Abib 16
  - Lev. 23:4-14, and
- a general harvest of ripe Barley about a month later.

In Leviticus 23:1 the Israelite is instructed to ..."bring to the priest a sheaf of the first grain you harvest". This is barley because it is the first grain to mature. In I Corinthians 15:23 the Apostle Paul applies this to Jesus. The jealousy offering (Numbers 5:15) is the only offering which specifically required barley flour.

Likewise there were two parts to the first resurrection:
- the firstfruits of "barley" in AD 30
  - Acts 26:23
  - 1 Cor. 15:20, 22-24
  - Col. 1:18
  - Rev. 1:5
  - 20:4-6
  - Matt. 27:53-54
  - Hos. 6:2
  - Is. 26:19
  - John 5:25
  - Eph. 4:8-10
  - Heb. 12:23
- the general harvest of "barley" in AD 70
  - Acts 24:15
  - 1 Cor. 15:23
  - Rev. 20:4-6
