Surreal numbers are the most natural
collection of numbers which includes both the
real numbers and the infinite ordinal numbers
of Georg Cantor.

They were invented by John H. Conway in 1969.

Every real number is surrounded by surreals,
which are closer to it than any real number.

Knuth (1974) describes the surreal numbers in
a work of fiction.

  The name actually came to me in the middle of
  the night; I have no idea...
  
  I have a vague recollection that I saw, at one
  point, a French paper that talked about
  'nombres sur ordinaux' I don't pronounce it
  well, but sort of sur- ordinal numbers I've
  never been able to track down that paper and I
  don't know if I heard about it before or after
  I thought of the name "surreal" but you'll see
  that it's a great name after you understand
  what surreal numbers are.
  
  John Conway invented the concept, and his
  first description of it was "All numbers great
  and small" Not only big and small, but
  *inside* and everything.

** Simple games

Some simple games have abbreviated names that can be expressed in terms of surreal numbers. For example, ~*={0|0}, 1={0|}, n={n-1|} for an integer n, 1/2={0|1}, ^={0|*}, and v={*|0}~. Most surreal numbers can be represented as hackenbush positions.

*** The Genesis of Surreal numbers

#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  In the beginning, everything was void, and
  J.H.W.H. Conway began to create numbers.
  
  Conway said, "Let there be two rules which
  bring forth all numbers large and small.
  
  This shall be the first rule:
  - Every number corresponds to two sets of
    previously created numbers, such that no
    member of the left set is greater than or
    equal to any member of the right set.
  
  And the second rule shall be this:
  - One number is less than or equal to
    another number if and only if no member of
    the first number's left set is greater than
    or equal to the second number, and no member
    of the second number's right set is less
    than or equal to the first number." And
    Conway examined these two rules he had made,
    and behold! They were very good.
  
  And the first number was created from the void
  left set and the void right set.
  
  Conway called this number "zero," and said
  that it shall be a sign to separate positive
  numbers from negative numbers.
  
  Conway proved that zero was less than or equal
  to zero, and he saw that it was good.
  
  And the evening and the morning were the day
  of zero.
  
  On the next day, two more numbers were
  created, one with zero as its left set and one
  with zero as its right set.
  
  And Conway called the former number "one," and
  the latter he called "minus one." And he
  proved that minus one is less than but not
  equal to zero and zero is less than but not
  equal to one.
  
  And the evening ...

A. I mean - here we are on the edge of the
Indian Ocean, miles away from civilization.
It's been months since we ran off to avoid
getting swept up in the system, and "to [[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/the-tapestry-of-truth/][find ourselves]]." I'm just wondering if you think
we've done it.

B. Actually, Alice, I've been thinking about the same thing. These
past months together have been really great-we're completely
free, we know each other, and we feel like real people again [[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/the-tapestry-of-truth/][instead of like machines]].
