** My dream
At 5am this morning I had a dream of perhaps 1000 people sitting on the ground within a building, all facing the same direction.
I myself was sitting between two friends of mine, Simon and Megan.
Simon asked me for a red fruit burst - Strawberry Flavour, which I gladly handed to him.
I then began speaking in tongues.
I also believe I felt bubbles of living water through my light body.
Also one such bubble came through the top of my head, through my ear and then down to my heart.

  glossolalia
  speaking in tongues
      A practice in which people utter words or
      speech-like sounds, often thought by
      believers to be languages unknown to the
      speaker.

I then woke up.

*** Outside - real life
The sun was up. was a yellow haze across the city.
The ground outside was golden.

** Prayer
#+BEGIN_SRC text -n :async :results verbatim code
  Dear Heavenly Father,
  May the grace extended to me, and the illumination of my house, extend to my friends.
  And may the false accuser, Satan meet a swift demise.
  In Jesus' name I ask,
  Amen

+ [[https://mullikine.github.io/posts/gospel-of-thomas/][Thomas 33]] :: Jesus said: What you hear with your ear (and) with the other ear, proclaim it on your roof-tops. For no one lights a lamp to set it under a bushel, or to put it in a hidden place; but he sets it on the lamp-stand, that all who go in and come out may see its light.

** Angelic tongues
Angelic tongues are the languages believed by
some religious traditions to be used by
angels. It usually refers to sung praise in
Second Temple period Jewish materials.
