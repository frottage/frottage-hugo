## One month ago: {#one-month-ago}

My statement to God.

-   [Love, Faithfulness, Truthfulness and Integrity // Bodacious Blog](https://mullikine.github.io/posts/faithfulness-and-truthfulness/)


## The mode of operation {#the-mode-of-operation}

A person can't stop in order to wait for a
rational explanation.

[Luke 9:62](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Luke%209%3A62)
: And Jesus said unto him, “No man, having put his hand to the plow and looking back, is fit for the Kingdom of God.”


## [Imago Dei](https://semiosis.github.io/posts/made-in-the-image-of-god/) {#imago-dei}

Humans are created with unique abilities,
absent in all other creatures of the earth,
that mirror the divine nature of God.

### The Pearl (monad of consciousness) {#the-pearl--monad-of-consciousness}

When we discover our [identity of Truth](https://mullikine.github.io/posts/the-tapestry-of-truth/), it's like learning to ride a bike or a unicycle, rather.
Initially, it's hard, but you quickly get the hang of it once you `grok` it.

The feeling is of having a vantage point.

We feel like we are teetering on the tip of a
spinning top, having never known before that
we could relocate, or that such an observation point existed.

The monad of conscious:

-   [What is a Monad? // Bodacious Blog](https://mullikine.github.io/posts/explaining-what-is-a-monad-for-melee/)
-   [Pistis Sophia - The Wisdom of Faith // Bodacious Blog](https://mullikine.github.io/posts/pistis-sophia/)

The pearl of truth is that sense that you are
in the panopticon of the world; You can see
every direction.


## Physical and Spiritual dynamis {#physical-and-spiritual-dynamis}

-   Retained by holding on to the pearl

---

`Spiritual dynamis`
: Requires a direct connection to spiritual truth.

`Physical dynamis`
: Accentuated by spiritual dynamis, requires sufficient abstraction over one's metaspacetime.

---

In reality, physical dynamis when coupled with spiritual dynamis is the same; The upper (angelic) is connected to lower (physical).


### Levels of awareness {#levels-of-awareness}

`Hylic`
: A person focused on neither intellectual (psychic) nor spiritual (pneumatic) reality. Unable to transcend the illusion and perceive the true reality since their thinking is entirely material, incapable of understanding the gnosis.

`Psychic`
: "soulful", partially initiated. Matter-dwelling spirits.

`Pneumatic`
: "spiritual", fully initiated, immaterial souls escaping the doom of the material world via gnosis.

---

-   A hylic person's actions are more of a side-effect of the dynamis of other people.
-   A psychic person's actions take advantage of virtual dynamis; The capability to produce fire, for example, through material knowledge.
-   A pneumatic person has spiritual dynamis; They may assume a Christ-like self-identity, and God brings about that reality for them. They live in faith.

## Forfeiting your own soul (Losing your pearl) {#forfeiting-your-own-soul--losing-your-pearl}

[Mark 8](https://biblehub.com/niv/mark/8.htm)
: 34 Then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said: “Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. 35 For whoever wants to save their life b will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me and for the gospel will save it. 36 What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?

This happens when a person becomes overly
mesmerised by artificial intelligence, or
material things.


## Surviving and keeping your soul {#surviving-and-keeping-your-soul}

-   <https://semiosis.github.io/posts/imaginary-internet-survival-guide/>


## Faith {#faith}

Faith is:

-   Having established your spiritual identity in the [Paraclete of Truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraclete),
-   Pressing forward and allowing God to [influence your beliefs](https://mullikine.github.io/posts/statement-of-faith/),
-   Believe in surreality,
-   Continue on with what you know is true despite there being demonic opposition.
    -   The demonic opposition is, for example, when you notice that everybody is trying to lure you away from the path of truth
        by saying you should make lots of money first so you can get whatever you want. Or perhaps the demonic opposition is when people slander your
        character or persona with lies; These people are not rooted in the truth and so they are demon possessed.

{{< youtube K2t3-S6eSUU >}}

Then they must be seeing into the dimension of truth/light.
When Peter walked to Jesus on the water he surely did.
But when he took his eyes off Jesus his attention went to the material world.
It matters what you look at.


## Push in hard to what you want {#push-in-hard-to-what-you-want}

Learn more than just intimately.

Transformers in combination with spirituality can transform a person's reality.

-   [Imaginary Internet Survival Guide `::` semiosis   Signs, Natural Language and Coding](https://semiosis.github.io/posts/imaginary-internet-survival-guide/)

You may think that you are in sovereign ownership of your own monad of consciousness.
If you don't have the Holy Spirit in you then you are wrong.

Somehow I must combine:

-   [Spiritual](https://mullikine.github.io/posts/thomas-22/) intimacy.
-   Pull what I need into your spiritual Lagrange point.
    -   [Dream 36](https://mullikine.github.io/posts/dream-resume/)
-   Sufficient abstraction to hold course through [metaspacetime](https://semiosis.github.io/posts/imaginary-internet-survival-guide/).
-   Melee's happiness.


## Glossary {#glossary}

{{< highlight text "linenos=table, linenostart=1" >}}
panopticon
    The panopticon is a disciplinary concept
    brought to life in the form of a central
    observation tower placed within a circle
    of prison cells.

    From the tower, a guard can see every cell
    and inmate but the inmates can't see into
    the tower.

    Prisoners will never know whether or not
    they are being watched.
{{< /highlight >}}

The sense you are on at the observation point
of the top of the spinning top of life.
